## ðŸš€ Coming Soon

OYRO is a privacy-first operating system giving **you** full ownership and control. Built on Debian with a sleek, custom Wayland Display Manager, OYRO is designed to be:

- **Secure**: Hardened defaults with minimal attack surface.
- **Modular**: Pluggable components for maximum flexibility.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized to run smoothly on a wide range of hardware.
- **Customizable**: Tailor every layerâ€”from the window manager to system services.

Stay tuned for development updates and the first alpha release!


## ðŸŒŸ Vision

OYRO aims to redefine the desktop experience by:

1. **User Empowerment**: Inspect, modify, and extend every layer.
2. **Privacy by Design**: Optional telemetry, full encryption support, transparent updates.
3. **Performance**: Lean core services and accelerated graphics with Wayland.
4. **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT for free use and contribution.
